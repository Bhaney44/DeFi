# FLASH LOAN ON ALGOFI

This is a standard triangle arbitrage on ALGOFI. Trading the testnet ASAs for USDC and STBL. In the example group transaction it made 4.706994 A profit. This was awkward to get because someone is arbitraging on the testnet for some reason so most of the arbitrage opportunities had been taken.

Play around with the tryMakeProfit() function, use different pools, different input values, see if you can make a profit too.
